This is the first API project on the freeCodeCamp Back End Development Certification

It is also my first time using GitHub

You can pass a string as a parameter, and it will check if the string is either a unix timestamp or a natural language date (example: July 31, 1990).

    If it is one of both, the app returns both the Unix timestamp and the natural language form of that date.
    If it isn't, it will return "null" for both properties.

If you want to try it, just check one of these urls:
